# ImpPack

A resource pack 
designed to improve some aspects of Vanilla.
Inspired by Vanilla Tweaks and Better Vanilla Buildings resource packs, and other versions and editions of Minecraft
Pack contains some Easter Eggs, and things related to the person who supported me at the beginning of this project creation

The asset pack's changelog is in a separate md file called CHANGELOG in the assets/.info directory
